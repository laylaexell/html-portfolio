<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am a recent graduate of BA Hons Graphic Arts at the University of Southampton.
  I now want to develop my skills, learning to become a web developer. First I will 
  tackle front end web development and see how I get on. I hoping with the combination 
  of skills from my graphic arts degree and these skills I learn from this course, I hope 
  to work my way up to have a good job and most importantly enjoy it.
